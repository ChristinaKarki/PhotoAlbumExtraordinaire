This project I did was part of the interview process for one of the company I applied in 2017.

Web Application Exercise
This exercise’s objective is to evaluate your performance on a project that is similar to what you
may encounter at this company. There is no time limit. Do something you are proud of. Questions are
welcome.

Requirements

1. Home page presents list of photo albums (title, owner’s name, and number of photos)
2. List is sortable by owner and number of photos
3. Clicking on an album shows list of photos with thumbnails
4. Clicking on a thumbnail shows full size photo
5. Allow albums/photos management (create, update, delete)
6. Allow searching for a photo by title
7. Data will come from the JSONPlaceholder fake API
( http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ), use the Albums, Photos, and Users resources
